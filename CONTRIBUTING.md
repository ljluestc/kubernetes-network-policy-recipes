## Overview

We welcome your contributions to this Kubernetes Network Policy Recipes project! This guide outlines the process for contributing patches, improvements, and new recipes to the repository.

## Objectives

- Understand the contribution process
- Complete necessary legal requirements
- Follow code review procedures
- Maintain quality and consistency
- Build a collaborative community

## Contribution Requirements

### Pre-commit Hooks (Required)

All contributors must use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and consistency.

**Installation:**
```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Install hooks in your local repository
cd kubernetes-network-policy-recipes
pre-commit install
```

**What hooks check:**
- YAML syntax and formatting
- Shell script linting (shellcheck)
- Markdown formatting
- Security (secret detection)
- Kubernetes API version validation
- BATS test existence for new recipes

**Running hooks:**
```bash
# Automatic on commit
git commit -m "Your message"

# Manual on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Manual on specific files
pre-commit run --files path/to/file
```

For detailed information, see [Pre-commit Hooks Guide](docs/PRE_COMMIT.md).

### Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project.

**CLA Submission:**
- Visit <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or to sign a new one
- You generally only need to submit a CLA once
- If you've already submitted one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it again

**Important Notes:**
- Individual contributors sign individual CLA
- Corporate contributors require corporate CLA signed by employer
- CLA must be on file before pull requests can be merged

### YAML Style

- 2-space indentation
- No tabs
- Quote strings when necessary
- Comment complex configurations
- Follow Kubernetes conventions

### Command Examples

```bash
# Use clear, copy-pasteable commands
kubectl apply -f policy.yaml

# Show expected output
# Expected:
# networkpolicy "example" created

# Include comments for clarity
```

## Testing

**Comprehensive Testing Guide**: See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for complete testing documentation.

### Testing Requirements

All contributions must meet these testing requirements:

1. **Pre-commit hooks pass** - All hooks must pass before committing
2. **BATS tests required** - Every new recipe must have BATS unit tests
3. **Integration tests** - Complex scenarios need integration tests
4. **Coverage threshold** - Overall coverage must be â‰¥ 95%
5. **Manual verification** - Test on actual Kubernetes cluster

### Quick Testing Checklist

```bash
# 1. Install pre-commit hooks (first time only)
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# 2. Run pre-commit checks
pre-commit run --all-files

# 3. Run BATS tests locally
cd test-framework
./run-all-bats-tests.sh

# 4. Run integration tests (if applicable)
./run-integration-tests.sh

# 5. Check coverage
./lib/coverage-tracker.sh report
./lib/coverage-enforcer.sh all
```

### Adding Tests for New Recipes

When adding a new NetworkPolicy recipe:

**Required: BATS Unit Test**

1. Create test file: `test-framework/bats-tests/recipes/XX-recipe-name.bats`
2. Include these test cases:
   - YAML syntax validation
   - Policy application
   - Traffic blocking (if deny policy)
   - Traffic allowing (if allow policy)
   - Label selector matching
   - Policy retrieval via kubectl
3. Use existing tests as templates
4. Verify locally: `bats test-framework/bats-tests/recipes/XX-recipe-name.bats`

**Optional: Integration Test**

Add integration test if recipe involves:
- Multiple policies working together
- Cross-namespace communication
- Complex multi-tier scenarios
- Performance-sensitive configurations

See [TESTING.md#writing-new-tests](TESTING.md#writing-new-tests) for detailed instructions.

### Pre-commit Checks

Before committing, ensure all pre-commit hooks pass:

```bash
# Run all hooks
pre-commit run --all-files

# Check specific aspects
pre-commit run yamllint --all-files      # YAML files
pre-commit run shellcheck --all-files    # Shell scripts
pre-commit run check-bats-tests          # Test coverage
```

**Pre-commit will automatically check:**
- YAML syntax and formatting
- Shell script linting (shellcheck)
- Markdown formatting
- Security (secret detection)
- Kubernetes API version validation
- BATS test existence for recipes

See [docs/PRE_COMMIT.md](docs/PRE_COMMIT.md) for complete pre-commit documentation.

### Manual Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. **Create test cluster** (if you don't have one)
   ```bash
   # Using kind
   kind create cluster --name np-test
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.26.1/manifests/calico.yaml
   ```

2. **Apply the policy**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f XX-recipe-name.md
   ```

3. **Verify expected behavior**
   ```bash
   # Create test pods
   kubectl run web --image=nginx --labels="app=web"
   kubectl run client --image=nginx --labels="app=client"

   # Test connectivity
   kubectl exec client -- wget -qO- --timeout=2 http://web
   ```

4. **Test edge cases**
   - Empty selectors
   - Cross-namespace scenarios
   - Port restrictions
   - Egress/ingress isolation

5. **Clean up resources**
   ```bash
   kubectl delete networkpolicy <policy-name>
   kubectl delete pod web client
   ```

6. **Document test results** in PR description

### CI/CD Testing

All pull requests trigger automated testing:

- **GitHub Actions** - Runs on every PR
  - Pre-commit hooks (all files)
  - BATS unit tests (115+ tests)
  - Integration tests (25 scenarios)
  - Coverage enforcement (95% threshold)
  - Performance regression checks

**PR must pass all CI checks before merge.**

See [test-framework/CICD.md](test-framework/CICD.md) for CI/CD documentation.

### Coverage Requirements

| Metric | Minimum | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Overall Coverage | 95% | 100% | Enforced in CI |
| BATS Unit Tests | 95% | 100% | Warning if below |
| Integration Tests | 90% | 100% | Warning if below |
| Recipe Coverage | 100% | 100% | Enforced in CI |

**Coverage is automatically calculated and enforced in CI/CD.**

Generate coverage report locally:
```bash
cd test-framework
./lib/coverage-tracker.sh report
./lib/coverage-tracker.sh html
open results/coverage-report.html
```

See [test-framework/COVERAGE.md](test-framework/COVERAGE.md) for coverage system documentation.
