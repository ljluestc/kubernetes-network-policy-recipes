# Product Requirements Document: 100% Test Coverage & CI/CD Integration

## Executive Summary
Achieve complete test coverage (100% integration, unit, and CI/CD pre-commit coverage) for the kubernetes-network-policy-recipes project with comprehensive automated testing, quality gates, and continuous validation.

## Project Goals
1. 100% Integration Test Coverage - All recipes and tools tested in real Kubernetes environments

3. 100% CI/CD Pre-commit Coverage - All code changes validated before merge
4. Zero untested code paths in production
5. Automated quality gates preventing regressions

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Test Infrastructure
