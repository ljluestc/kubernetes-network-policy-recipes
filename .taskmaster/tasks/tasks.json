Include configuration options for max parallel workers and test batching strategies.\n<info added on 2025-10-15T03:41:17.382Z>\nI'll analyze the current codebase to understand the existing test framework and provide specific implementation details for the parallel execution enhancement.Based on my analysis of the existing codebase, here's the new text content that should be appended to the subtask details:\n\nAnalysis reveals test-all-policies.sh currently tests only 4 out of 16 available network policy recipes (NP-01, NP-02, NP-09, NP-11) with sequential execution and basic console output. Missing recipes include NP-03 through NP-08, NP-10, NP-12 through NP-14, plus the newly discovered recipes (02a, 13). Will implement GNU parallel-based framework using job queue architecture with configurable worker pools (default 4 workers), proper namespace isolation per test (using unique namespace suffixes), and JSON output format for structured test results. Framework will include test discovery mechanism to automatically detect all numbered recipe files, timeout handling per test (configurable, default 60s), resource cleanup with parallel namespace deletion, and batch execution strategies. Implementation will extend existing test functions in test-all-policies.sh while maintaining backward compatibility with current test_np01-11 functions and adding new test functions for missing recipes. Output will include detailed timing metrics, resource usage statistics, and aggregated pass/fail results in both human-readable and machine-parseable formats.\n</info added on 2025-10-15T03:41:17.382Z>",
